Resume Review Requests
Overview
Resume Review Requests is a feature within the Public Profile Hub that allows users to seek valuable feedback on their resumes from mentors, peers, or industry experts. As of June 29, 2025, it fosters a collaborative environment to refine application materials.
How It Works
Users send review requests via unique links or email invitations, specifying reviewers (e.g., LinkedIn contacts). The AI moderates feedback, flagging constructive comments and integrating them into a summary report. Reviewers can view the resume, add notes, and rate sections (e.g., 8/10 for skills).
