Job Application Tracker
Overview
The Job Application Tracker is a centralized dashboard within the AI Resume Builder that organizes job applications, tracks progress, and manages deadlines. As of June 29, 2025, it helps users stay on top of their job search, storing resumes, cover letters, and notes in one intuitive interface.
How It Works
The tracker uses a relational database to log application details (e.g., company, job title, dates) and syncs with calendar tools for reminders. It categorizes applications by status (e.g., Submitted, Interview) and provides visual analytics, such as a pie chart of final results (e.g., Accepted vs. Rejected). AI suggests follow-up actions based on application age and industry norms.

Set Reminders: Input a reminder date (e.g., 05/07/2025) and check "Follow Up" if needed.
