Share Success Stories & Posts
Overview
Share Success Stories & Posts enables users to publish articles, project highlights, and personal achievements within the Public Profile Hub. As of 11:37 AM AEST on June 29, 2025, it builds a professional narrative to attract recruiters and peers.
How It Works
Users create posts using a rich-text editor, adding images, links, and formatted text. The AI suggests tags and optimizes content for search engines. Posts are published with timestamps (e.g., 04/05/2025 10:27) and can be edited or deleted, with a moderation queue for quality control.
